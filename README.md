I Chose the *Video* how to over-engineer a website as the source of my article as I found it very relevant to the topics we are learning in this Software Development class. 


Firstly, Firebase is a youtube channel that very consizely summarizes important software engineering technologies (and other comoputer science topics too).

In the video, Jeff explains what a tech stack is, and then moves on to talk about different popular tech stacks and comparing them. Then he moves on to the most important part - choosing your own tech stack.

He goes into details on why he is choosing a technology for each part of his stack (front-end, api, back-end ... ). He also goes into details like choosing the technology for the web server and containerizing.
